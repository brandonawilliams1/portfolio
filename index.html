                <h1>Welcome To My Incredible Journey!</h1>
                <p>An introduction to my journey as a software developer.
                    I became a software developer because down to my core I love to create. Creating is essential to my person, in one of the ways I love to express this is having the ability to discover problems and then create solutions.
                </p><br>

                <p>While still learning to build, I'm learning how to approach software development from a pragmatic point of view that prioritizes the user's expireance first. Far to often software applications can be too obtuse for sections of it users. Having the ability to bring apllications that are easy to traverse, fast, reliable, secure, as well as sitting at the cutting edge of technology is my passion.</p><br>
                
                <p>"In relation to product, this includes users, but is also inclusive to others that are as essential.People that support the product and are key to the success of the business and the health of its relationship with the user. Also prospects, people that might eventually become users of the product. Their needs also matter and are key to the growth of the product.

                Regardless of nomenclatureâ€¦ empathy through listening and representing everyone that uses, might use, and supports your product, is essential to a successful business. That is your audience."- Jonah Bitautus</p><br>
